                    Okay so what gear will you need to get started? You might think you need just a drone and a controller, but nope you need a LOT more than just that! Heres a list of everything you will need to get started, than we'll go over exactly what everything is used for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drone</li>

                    <li>FPV Simulator</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Optional Gear (but highly recomended!!!):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spare Propellers</li>
                    <li>Even More Spare Propellers</li>
                    <li>Tools</li>
                    <li>Field Backpack</li>

                <p>
                    Okay now lets break down the main things of what you need and explain what everything is, how its used, and why you need it!

                        <h3>Drone</h3>
                        <p>The core of the hobby, the entire reason why your even buying this gear! Buying a solid drone is critical to being able to get the most out of your flying! </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="GearCard">
                        <h3>Radio (Controller)</h3>
                        <p>The radio (or controller) is how you control the drone! There are many different types, but generally they are either box style or game controller style. Heres a great guide on how to choose a perfect radio: <a href="https://oscarliang.com/radio-transmitter/">OscarLiang.com</a></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="GearCard">
                        <h3>Goggles</h3>
                        <p>The goggles round out the core trinity of this hobby. These along with the drone and radio allow you to actually fly the drone! What makes this hobby unique is the ability to see the world from the drones persepctive and not yours (boring none flying animal). Heres a great guide on how to choose a perfect pair of goggles: <a href="https://oscarliang.com/fpv-goggles/">OscarLiang.com</a></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="GearCard">
                        <h3>Antennas</h3>
                        <p>Antennas are what enable the communication between all of our devices! Choosing a good antenna can be extremely important to being able to fly more than 5 feet away, and can be extremely important for getting the insane range you might see in some videos!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="GearCard">
                        <h3>Batteries</h3>
                        <p>Ahhhh batteries. This is what powers everything! If you get into this hobby your going to have lots of batteries, lots of them. This hobby uses "LiPo" batteries (short for lithium-ion polymer battery) as well as "Li-ion" batteries (short for lithium-ion).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="GearCard">
                        <h3>Battery Charger</h3>
                        <p>With all your batteries you aren't just going to fly them each once and throw them away like a AA battery. Nope we charge these back up! A good safe charger is very useful and can help you save a lot of time being able to charge multiple at once!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="GearCard">
                        <h3>Propellers</h3>
                        <p>Your going to crash. Your going to crash again. Your going to crash so many times your going to forget how many times you've crashed. And the propellers are by far the easiest and most common component to break! Your going to want replacements for not if but <strong>when</strong> you crash, to get you back up in the skies quickly!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="GearCard">
                        <h3>FPV Simulator</h3>
                        <p>An FPV simulator many beginners to the hobby might write off at first, but realistically this is almost <strong>more</strong> needed than a drone is. Learning to fly these FPV drones is EXTREMELY hard!!! You will need practice in a simulator to help you learn, and these drones are not cheap either! Better to learn and crash tens if not hundreds of times when you can click a button and get a new drone instead of crashing outside when a new drone might take a few weeks to get and cost you a few hundred bucks!</p>
