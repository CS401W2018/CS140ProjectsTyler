                    So, you've gotten your drone and all the gear you need to get started. Now it's time to brea- I mean have fun with the drone!!! Lets teach you some tricks so you can learn some control!

            <!-- Trick 1 -->
            <div class="TrickSection">
                <h2>Trick 1: Power Loop</h2>
                <p>
                    The power loop! Such an iconic FPV drone trick. It involves as the name says, going in a loop! But what makes this trick actually fun is going in a loop <strong>around</strong> something which is what can make this a little harder. And the "Power" part of name, comes from how you do it, as you pull up on the stick aiming the drone upwards after going below something you don't just let off the throttle, you keep that throttle stick <strong>ALL</strong> the way up (or however much your comfortable with, style points for full throttle!). It allows you to zip in a tight circle looking cool from the outside and really really cool from inside the goggles from the drones perspective!

            <!-- Trick 2 -->
            <div class="TrickSection">
                <h2>Trick 2: Split S</h2>
                <p>
                    The "Split S" is not just a fun trick, but super useful if you want to film some cinematic footage. It involves you going up doing almost a mini powerloop, and pulling into a dive, almost like if you look at the letter "S" and start from midway and follow the letter up with your drone. It allows you to learn, along with the powerloop, to be upside down, and really is just a critical move you learn if you want to do anything cinematic whatsoever!!!

            <!-- Trick 3 -->
            <div class="TrickSection">
                <h2>Trick 3: Matty Flip</h2>
                <p>
                    The matty flip! This wasn't neccessarily "invented" by "Matty" but it was certainly popularized by him! This is really where you start to see how you can crash FPV drones really easily. But this trick is effectively a reverse powerloop, where instead of going below and object, and curving up and back around, this trick you go over the object, do almost a half flip forward, and come back around from the bottom! This trick isn't too hard, but at first it can be very nerve wracking to do as this is one of the first easy tricks that requires you to fly backwards, where you don't know exactly where your going or if your about to smash into anything!
