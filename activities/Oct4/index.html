        <h3>When should you use a background image, and when should you use the IMG tag?</h3>
        <p>
            You should use an img tag when you want an image within your content, similar to how a p tag is used for text or a h1 tag is used for a title. Specifically if I have a research paper or something, and I want to showcase a graph or something, than that would be an apropriate time to use an img tag because that image is part of your content. You should use a background image when you want to make your website look good. This is only really used to help you website look more aestheticly pleasing. So in summary img tag for when an image is part of the content your trying to relay to the user and use a background tag when you want to make your website look better, and the image doesn't have any important information.
