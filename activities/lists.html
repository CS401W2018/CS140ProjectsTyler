    <h2>What is the best way to make sure you get a good grade on the projects?</h2>
    <p>
        The best way to ensure I get a good grade on projects is to:
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure I turn it in on time</li>
            <li>Double check before turning it in that my HTML is correct and follows the guidlines of the assignment</li>
            <li>I can also ask for TA or teacher to check my project before I turn it in if I have it done prior to the deadline</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
    <h2>When is your project due?</h2>
    <p>Our projects are due before 5 AM on monday mornings, preferably just have it done <strong>before</strong> I go to bed</p>
