        <h1>Tylers Website!</h1>

            HTML CSS JavaScript Backet Frontend
        </nav>

    <main>
        <h1>Welcome to Web Development!</h1>

        <h2>Header</h2>
        <p>
            The title and important information go in the header! The nav bar
            can also sometimes go in the header if you want. Basically any information
            that explains what the entire website is about!
        </p>

        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            
            It should contain links to navigate around the website, should remain the same accross pages
            navigation stays the same between pages.
            The nav can go in the header or not, just depends on what the developer wants.
            But it also should only contain links to get around <strong>your </strong> website,
            generally we would never link a different website in the navigation bar. 
        </p>

        <h2>Main Content</h2>
        <p>
            
            Main is where you put the content of your website so it should change
            between different pages on your website. This is the <strong>meat </strong>
            of your website, the stuff the user should interact with. 
        </p>

        <h2>Footer</h2>
        <p>
            Footer - good for copyright,
            social media links,
            also cookie prefrences, to allow user to opt out of cookies
            also privacy notices and legal notices
        </p>

        <h2>HTML Validation</h2>
        <p>
            Firefox uses Mozilla Chrome and Safari use webkit.
            Easiest way to find a validator is to just
            search "HTML Validator" on google. We need to fix
            validation errors for projects but we don't need to
            worry about them for engagments!
