                1: The JPEG file type is best used for photos that have a lot of detail in them, lots of colors and lots of detail. 
                <br>
                <br>
                2: The GIF file type is best used for simpler images without many colors or detail, as well as really short animations.
                <br>
                <br>
                3: the .PNG file type is unique for a couple reasons, but one is that its able to support transparent photos as it has an extra channel that says how transparent each pixel is. And then it also has "lossless compression" so if the image is compressed it doesn't lose detail.
                <br>
                <br>
                4: Using CSS you can resize your photo by adjusting the Width and Height of the photo via a class or ID. If you use just one (height or width) it will adjust the other dimension automatically to make sure the image isn't stretched at all. But if you include both height AND width than it will stretch the image to fit the values you put. 
                <br>
                <br>
                5: You should resize photos via a photo editing software instead of resizing via CSS because when you resize with CSS the user still has to download the image and then CSS resizes it. If it's really big than it can take longer to download to their device and it will take up more data for the user than if you used a smaller base picture.
