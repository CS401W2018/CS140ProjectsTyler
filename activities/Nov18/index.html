            <p><strong>1. What is DNS</strong></p>
            <p>DNS is the system that allows us to type in a URL like "google.com" into the search bar and it will take us to google. It allows us to be able to memorize URLs instead of IP addresses, like typing in google.com instead of 8.8.8.8, it's basically the system that assigns the URL to the IP address.</p>
    
            <p><strong>2. How do you get a domain name?</strong></p>
            <p>To get a domain name you can go to a domain name registrar such as Namecheap or GoDaddy, and purchase a domain from them.</p>
    
            <p><strong>3. What is SSL</strong></p>
            <p>SSL is a protocol for encrypting data in motion when it is being transferred from the user to the web server. It is just a layer of encryption on the data you're sending to a web server to keep it safe.</p>
    
            <p><strong>4. How do you get a security certificate?</strong></p>
            <p>To get a security certificate you can go directly to a certificate authority and purchase it through them, but in my experience many hosting sites that I've seen offer built-in SSL and you can get free certificates from places like "Let's Encrypt" and such.</p>
    
            <p><strong>5. How does SSL work?</strong></p>
            <p>SSL works by first when a user visits a website with SSL, the browser and server exchange info to be able to create a secure, encrypted connection to each other. When creating that first connection, the server sends over its SSL certificate to the browser which the browser verifies is authentic via the certificate authority's public key. Once the browser verifies that the SSL certificate is authentic, the browser and server are then able to create a session key to encrypt the data between the two devices with. Then from that point on both parties use that session key to make sure all the data in motion between the two devices is secure.</p>
    
            <p><strong>6. How do you stay safe online?</strong></p>
            <p>To stay safe online, try to stay on websites that have "HTTPS" in its URL which means they use SSL.</p>
