                        What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.
                        <p>
                            The difference between block tags and inline tags are that block create a little "box" around the specific tag and that inline tags don't, they just kind of just function like text almost like this text I'm writing. So for example a &lt;p&gt; tag creates a little "box" around this text! but if i use a <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> tag it makes that text bolded! It didn't create a box and seperate out that text from other stuff it just let it sit within the text. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What is the margin, border, and padding?
                        <p id = "borderShow">
                            The margin is an invisible "ring" almost around a box created via a block tag! Its the space that seperates out text. So similar to how theres a giant "box" around all of the content on this page, i've made it so that the margin on the left and right "push" it towards the center. The border for a block tag is effectively the "outside" of the box. It is literally the border between that box and the next box. We can change the line thickness and such, and thats what i've done to this text! Thats what the box around it is, its the border. And then the padding is what allows us to "move" the text within the "box" of a block tag. Its what allows me to move the text within this to be slightly away from the edges of the border!

                        What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?
                        <p>
                            Theres a ton of units we can use to measure in CSS! Heres a list of just some of the measurment units we can use in css:
                            <ul>
                                <li>vw</li>
                                <li>%</li>
                                <li>px</li>
                                <li>cm</li>
                                <li>mm</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When would you use a figure tag?
                        <p>
                            You would use a figure tag when you want to treat an image as a "box". The &lt;img&gt; tag is an inline tag so when you include an image into your website, the html treats it as just normal text not as a box. So if you want to add something fancy like a border around it or add a caption to it, or just position it in a different place, thats when we can use the &lt;figure&gt; tag! Heres an example:
                        </p>
                        <figure id="beachPicWrapper">
                            <img src="beach.jpeg" alt="a fancy smancy picture of the beach!" id = "beachPic">
                            <caption>A super cool picture of the beach!</caption>
                        </figure>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </main>
