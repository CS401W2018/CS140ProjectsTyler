                What I learned today about Flex and CSS is how Flex works and how its different from CSS Grid. I learned today how flex allows the children to determine their sizes, and how it differs from grid in that way, because Grid defines the sizes of the children. I also learned how to with flex, decide the direction that you want the list to show via "flex-direction" in CSS.

                You need to have an accessible website website so that people with dissabilities can still use and navigate your website. For example if you don't label images properly someone who's blind might not be able to know what the picture is about or even that there is a picture cause the screenreader might skip over it. You also can get sued if you don't have an accessible website. An accessible website means that screenreaders, people who are colorblind, and people who might not be able to use a mouse very well, can still use it and navigate around your website.
