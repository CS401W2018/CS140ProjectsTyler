        <p>
            <strong>CSS</strong> - Cascading Style Sheets.
        </p>
        <h2>Inline CSS</h2>
        <p style = "color: red;">
            Hello world! This is colored using inline CSS!
            You do it by doing &lt;p style = "color: red;" &gt;. Don't do this on my assignments!
        </p>
        <h2>Embedded CSS</h2>
        <p class = "embedded">
            Hello world! This is colored using embedded CSS!
            You do it by using the &lt;style&gt; tag! Than you can put in
            all your css there! I put the style tag within the header! Heres an example: 
            <br>
            <br>
            &lt;style&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.embedded{<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue;<br>
                }<br>
            &lt;/style&gt;
            <br>
            Don't use this either on my assignments!!!
        </p>
        <h2>External CSS</h2>
        <p class = "external">
            Hello World! This was colored using external CSS! To use this you want to add &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css"&gt; to your header! This is you saying "hey theres another file attatched to this one load it by going here!"
            <br>
            This is the superior way because it can help us save time! It helps you keep all of your web pages looking the same! It allows us to not have to copy and paste the same css, and allows us to use ONE file for all of our HTML pages! One change in this file changes all of the files! Also another reason is because of "seperation of concerns", a lot of computer scientists and programmers may not have the skills to make GOOD looking website, which is why we have graphic designers and user experience experts, and they if they want to go in and change how things look, can just go in and edit the CSS file without having to know HTML at all!
        </p>
        <h2>Selectors</h2>
        <p>
            Selectors are used to ensure you style the things you want to style! So it ensures that say THIS paragraph isn't green or blue, I want it just like normal! But the paragrpah above I want green! So using selectors I can ensure that the paragrpah ABOVE is green and not THIS one!
