        <h2>Absolute vs Relative</h2>
        <h3>Absolute Links</h3>
        <p>
            These links are the entire link. It includes the "https://", the "www." and such.
            Its the kind of link you put when trying to go to a website on the web! Good for linking
            to external websites!
        </p>
        <h3>Relative Links</h3>
        <p>
            These are good when linking to things within your own page! It is to <strong>your</strong>
            website only, it directs you to other files in your project! 
        </p>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rule 1: . = means the current folder (not used on the web)</li>
                <li>Rule 2: .. = means the parent folder.</li>
                <li>Rule 3: / <em>at the beginning</em> = start at the root</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Links do not only have to be inside of the nav tag! They can be placed
            pretty much anywhere in your website!
