                    <strong>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</strong>
                    <p>The difference between a block and an inline tag is that block tags have "boxes" around them. Tags such as the div, p, body, main, header, etc. all are considered box tags, where they seperate itself via an invisible box around the content from other parts on the website. Inline tags are tags that function as text, similar to all this text within this paragraph, such as the strong, img, em tags. They don't seperate themselves from content because they are the content. </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>What is normal flow in HTML?</strong>
                    <p>Normal flow in HTML is just the default way that elements are stacked on top of each other and how like block tags all stack on top of each other and then inline tags just function as text</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</strong>
                    <p>Float allows us to put things side by side in HTML! It almost like anchors the object to the left or right and then all other content "flows" around it. This removes a lot of the space below the specific box tag that were adding float to. You need to clear the float to allow spacing between content to still happen, almost similar to stopping a river so certian parts aren't "flowing". So for instance since we want the footer always at the bottom we want to probably clear the float at the very end of the main tag to ensure theres proper spacing between the main and footer tags!</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</strong>
                    <p>Absolute, fixed and relative are all ways of positioning block tags. Absolute puts the block tag EXACTLY where you have it, so x pixels and y pixels for the screen, making it so if you have different screen sizes it'll mess up. Fixed fixes the image directly to your screen so even if you scroll it'll stay in the same spot. And then relative positions it "relative" to other items so the web page is roughly the same no matter what your screen size is. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</strong>
                    <p>By turning the navigation buttons into an unordered list it can allow us to do more with css to the nav bar. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</strong>
                    <p>You can find them by going to the Lecture Notes for each week and it'll have all the lecture videos in case you missed or need a complete refresher on what was talked about.</p>
