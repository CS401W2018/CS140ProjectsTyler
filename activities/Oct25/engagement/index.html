        <h1>Engagement - Page for Print</h1>
        <p>(This is a page just to answer the engagement questions, I have a seperate one with the stuff from in class today)</p>

        <h3>1</h3>
        <p>The viewport meta tag is important because it helps the browser and the html "talk" to each other, allowing the web page to be able to be displayed for different screen sizes.</p>


        <h3>2</h3>
        <p>One way your able to adjust the CSS of a website to make it optimized for printing, is to link 2 stylesheets, and instead of having "media = "screen"" you put "media = "print"" in the link tag and that tells the web browser to use that particular stylesheet for printing instead of the other one thats used for regular displaying of the website when looking at it on a web browser. </p>

        <h3>3</h3>
        <p>You would want to adjust the CSS of a website for printing when you expect the user to print out the website, for instance like a ticket to a concert or printing out receipts. You want to adjust the CSS to remove things like the navigation bar, and probably the footer as well because when someone prints out the website they won't need the navigation they just need the main content of the page.</p>
