        <p>
            Brackeys is one of the most prominant youtube channels in the game development scene.
            While he doesn't post often if at all anymore, his channel provides some of the best 
            tutorials there are on how to learn and do certain things in game development. He 
            has been an insane help to me as I've grown my game development and coding skills, and
            I know he has been a major help to many others as well when they are learning and growing
            their own game development skills.
