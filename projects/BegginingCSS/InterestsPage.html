         <h2>What is game design?</h2>
        <p>
            So as the name suggests game design is the creation of games! Game design
            is one of my favorite hobbies to do in my spare time but it sometimes isn't
            easy! To make games I use the Unity Game engine, which comes with many
            useful tools to the creation of games. Unity is one of the most used 
            game engines in the world used by many many games, along with Unreal engine
            and newcomer Godot, which has just started gaining popularity in the 
            game development engine scene. With the Unity game engine I use the language
            C# to write my scripts for different gameobjects within my games. Most 
            of the time each object you see within a game has its own script that controls
            how that obejct interacts with other objects within the game to make something
            fun to play!

        <h2>Why do I love game design?</h2>
        <p>
            Theres a few reasons of why I love game design. The first reason is it
            is it's a lot of fun to create something that others can play and have
            fun with. The feeling of finishing a project and watching someone test
            my game is unparalleled, its just a really unique feeling watching 
            someone else play something <strong>you</strong> have created. I also
            really enjoy it because it's a hobby that I can collaborate with other
            people in. Something like my other hobbies such as drone flying, there
            isn't nearly as much possible colaboration that you can have with others,
            but with game design I'm able to get to meet new people and its something
            I can also do together with my brother who I have a very close relationship
            with.

        <p>
            <strong>Absolute Links: </strong> Absolute links are links that lead to outside
            websites! Absolute links are links that contain the entire link, such as the "www."
            and the "https://" part.

            <strong>Relative Links: </strong>Relative links are links that lead to other places
            in your website! These links only need to contain the relative file path to the
            different html file you want to link to. So they don't need the "www." or "https" 
            when using relative links.
