        <h2>Internet</h2>
        <p>
            The internet is effectively the connection of all computers. Its the ability
            for different computers to send data and information to each other
            not having to be physically hooked up to each other and its what allows
            the web to exist.
        </p>
        <h2>Web</h2>
        <p>
            The web stand for the world wide web and is basically the transfering of files
            that make up websites to and from different computers via the internet. The 
            files that make up the web are made out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        </p>
        <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
        <p>
            The internet and the web are different because one is the transfering of data
            and one is the data itself. The internet provides us the ability to send and
            recieve the web, and the files that make up web pages.
        </p>
        <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
        <p>
            ASCII and Unicode are methods of encoding for characters in computers. ASCII is
            the older version and Unicode is the newer system that includes many languages 
            symbols and some emojis. It assigns a number to each character and is how the computer
            represents it in its own storage.
        </p>
        <h2>What is UTF-8</h2>
        <p>
            UTF-8 is a way to encode Unicode characters. It stores characters in 1-4 bytes
            and is the most common way of representing text on websites. It stands for Unicode
            Transformation Format 
        </p>
        <h2>URL</h2>
        <p>
            A URL is the thing you type into the browser such as google.com that lets you
            access a web page or something else on the internet. 
        </p>
        <h2>Domain Name</h2>
        <p>
            A domain name is a readable name that points to a specific IP address where a websites
            is hosted and is part of a URL and helps people get to website more easily instead of 
            having to memorize an IP address. 
        </p>
        <h2>HTTP</h2>
        <p>
            Is the protocal first used by the web to send and recieve data between a web browser
            and a web server. 
        </p>
        <h2>HTTPS</h2>
        <p>
            HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP that uses SSL or TLS and encryptes the data being
            sent.
        </p>
        <h2>IP Address</h2>
        <p>
            An IP address is a list of numbers that is unique to your computer and tells you apart 
            from others when connected to the internet. Its the way one computer can connect to another
            computer.
        </p>
        <h2>DNS</h2>
        <p>
            DNS stands for domain name system and translates domain names into IP address so computers
            can identify each other and make it easier for humans to get to web pages as you only need
            to remember a domain name and not the full IP address of something like google.com.
        </p>
        <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
            W3C Stands for world wide web consortium and it is a list of guidlines and standards
            for web technologies created by W3C. The recomendations list things such as HTML and CSS
            best practices for things like accessbility and security.
        </p>
        <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
        <p>
            XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language and is a text format used for storing and sending
            data. Designed to be readable by both humans and computers.
            <br>
            XHTML stands for eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language and is a version of HTMl that follows
            rules of XML.
