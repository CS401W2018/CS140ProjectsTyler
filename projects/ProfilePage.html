    <h2>Interest 1: Flying FPV Drones</h2>
    <p>
        One of my favorite things to do is fly <strong>FPV</strong> drones.
        These drones are special because instead of flying through a normal
        controller and screen, I'm wearing goggles and get to see a first person
        view of what the drone sees. With these drones, you're able to do
        a lot more than a normal drone, like performing <em>flips</em>
        and <em>spins</em>. The hard part about these drones is they are
        completely manual, so there's no fancy sensors or anything stopping
        the drone if you're about to hit something, so crashing is very common!
    </p>
    <h2>Interest 2: Coding</h2>
    <p>
        One of my other favorite interest is coding! The main coding languages i've used
        so far is <code>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and C#.</code> I've made a lot of projects
        with these languages but some of my favorites are: Facial Recognition Attendance System,
        Metroidvania Game Jam Game, and my neural network thats build to play pokemon by
        interacting with websites! I just love being able to make things that are super cool
        via code, its a very rewarding feeling when something works!
