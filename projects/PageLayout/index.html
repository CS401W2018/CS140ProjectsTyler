                <p>
                    The precision of luxury watches is what holds a lot of appeal for some people. When you have a mechanical watches it can be extremely hard to make them extremely accurate. A lot of cheap mechanical watches can lose and gain around 15 to 30 seconds per day which can lead to you haveing to reset the watch to the correct time quite often. When you pay for something like a Rolex, you are partially paying for their precision in keeping the time. A company like Rolex guarantees their watches stay either -2 to +2 seconds to the time every day which is extremely precise for a mechanical watch.

            <div class = "Brand">
                <h3>Brand</h3>
                <p>
                    Of course a lot of what your paying for with any luxury item is the brand name. Its similar to how luxury clothes, luxury items (like bags, sunglasses and other accessories), and even high end jewlery, your paying for the name. A lot of these items without the name could be sold for significantly less than what the companies actually sell them for. And this can be partially what makes these items considered "luxury" is just because the prices are out of the range that 99% of people can afford. Its what can make a lot of watches such as Rolex, so highly prized and so well known, being prized gems of many peoples watch collections.
