            <h2><strong>1. What is the title and topic of your site?</strong></h2>
            <p>
                For the title of my site I plan on titleing it "FPV Drones". For the topic of the site it will be about FPV drones and a comprehensive guide all about them!
            </p>

            <h2>2. Why did you choose this topic?</h2>
            <p>
                I chose this topic because this is one of my hobbies I'm really passionate about and it is something that I believe will be easy for me to write original content about it. Also, its a hobby I havn't been able to do while in hawaii since I left all my gear at home and it can be an opportunity to remind myself about this hobby that I love doing so that when I get home for winter break I can jump into flying my drones!!!
            </p>

            <p>>3. What content will you have on the home page and each of the five content pages (one page will have a table)?</p>
            <p>
                The content I plan on having on the home page will be a video embeded into the page with an example of what FPV drone flying really is, along with a paragraph explaining and introducing FPV drone flying. The first of the five content pages I plan on having types of FPV drones, where I'll highlight and talk about the 3 different categories of FPV drones, racing, freestyle, and cinewhoop with images and paragraphs explaining each type. For the 2nd of the 5 content pages I plan on having a "getting started page" where itll include a simple checklist of gear that you would need to get started within this hobby with links to places where you can buy it. For the 3rd content page I plan on having a drone components page, that will include a table, this page will really focus on all the drone components needed to build your own freestyle drone with pricing, links, and part names. For the 4th content page I plan on doing an "FPV tips and tricks" page where itll have tips on learning to fly as well as tricks you can preform that can help you learn to control the drone, as well as just a tutorial of how to preform some beggining tricks with the drone. For the 5th content page I plan on doing a guide to FPV simulators and some of the pros and cons of the popular simulators. For the form processing page I plan on having a "contact us page" that will contain the form processing stuff to collect the users information. 
            </p>

            <p>>4. What fields (or information) will you collect in your form? What data will go on your table?</p>
            <p>
                For the contact us page, it will have things such as: First name, last name, email, phone number, region in the USA. And for the table, the data that will go in it will be drone component names (Example: "ESC", "Flight Controller", etc.), and the name of the drone component I recomend for the example build im giving, as well as a link to a place where you can buy it as well as the price of the component in the drone. 
            </p> 

            <p>>5. How will you collect information, images, and content for your site? List out at least 2 references you plan to use.</p>
            <p>
                To collect information such as images I plan on using things such as wikipedia and google to find images with the creative commons license that I am able to use, as well as having pictures sent to me from family at home of my drone and equiment. For the content of my page I plan on just using my prior knowledge. And then for examples of things such as tricks, and examples of what FPV drone flying is, I plan on just using Youtube videos that contain fpv flying. For the 2 specific references I plan on using is wikipedia for the images, and the youtube channel I plan on using "Johnny FPV"'s youtube channel as he has videos that I can embed into the project as well as having very great examples of proffesional level FPV drone flying.

            <p>>6. Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</p>
